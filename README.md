**SideTask** is a powerful VS Code extension that finds all the TODOs, FIXMEs, and other task comments scattered across your project and brings them into one organized view in your activity bar.

Stop losing track of pending tasks and technical debt. If it's in your code, it's on your list.

## Features (MVP v0.1.0)

This is the first release of SideTask, focusing on the essential features to get you organized:

* **🌲 Unified Tree View:** See all found tasks in a clean, collapsible tree view, neatly organized by file.
* **⌨️ Default Keywords:** Automatically scans your project for `TODO:`, `FIXME:`, and `HACK:`.
* **🖱️ Click-to-Go:** Instantly jump to the exact line of any task in your code just by clicking on it in the side panel.
* **🔄 Manual Refresh:** A simple "Refresh" button in the view's title bar to re-scan your workspace at any time.

## What's Next? (Roadmap)

SideTask is just getting started. Our goal is to make this the *ultimate* task management tool for developers, right inside the editor. Here is what's planned:

* **✨ Custom Highlighting:** Define your own keywords (like `NOTE:`, `BUG:`) and give them custom colors.
* **🎛️ Advanced Filtering:** Filter tasks by keyword, tag, or file.
* **⚡ Smart Snippets:** Quickly create new TODO items with keyboard shortcuts.
* **🚀 [PRO] Integrations:** Connect SideTask to your favorite tools like **Notion**, **Jira**, and **Trello** to turn code comments into real tasks.
